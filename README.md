# badgerverse.app

**badgerverse.app** is a simple front-end that displays a _person_'s (or other _actor_'s) profile and (text, image, etc) labels from decentralized social-media (DeSo), including the Fediverse.

Ideally, every DeSo (web-based, mobile-based, etc) front-end would include labels themselves.
